# Customizing Attributions

See the [attribution hook]({{< relref "Hooks#attribution" >}})
and the [forward-attribution hook]({{< relref "Hooks#forward-attribution" >}})
for information on customizing attributes (the strings that Csup uses
to mark quoted text when replying to or forwarding messages).
